Hi there! I'm just starting my exciting journey into the world of Machine Learning and Data Analysis. This repository is my little corner on the internet where I play with data, try out cool ML models, and learn as I go. It's a bit like a diary, but with more numbers and graphs.

**Simple ML Models: **I'm starting with easy-peasy models. Think of them as the ABCs of Machine Learning. We're talking Linear Regression, which is like making a straight line fit through points, and other beginner-friendly stuff.
**EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):** This is where I play detective with data. I look at data sets, ask them questions, and try to understand their stories. It's a bit like being a data detective!
